This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
### `npm run deploy`

So, in this project I created two custom scripts on package.json. predeploy (runs before deploy) which does a `npm run build` and and this one (the deploy) that runs `gh-pages -d build` that publishes the app on the "homepage" url on the package.json
